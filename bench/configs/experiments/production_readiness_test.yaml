name: "production_readiness_test"
description: "Comprehensive evaluation for main branch readiness using all real datasets"

# Test each dataset individually to ensure they all work
datasets:
  - "roboflow_plastic_defects"  # Your custom dataset
  - "tarros_dataset"            # Container dataset  
  - "gc10_det"                  # Metal defects
  - "neu_surface_defects"       # Steel defects

# Reasonable sample size for comprehensive evaluation
