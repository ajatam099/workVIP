## Executive Summary

### Project Motivation and SME Context

The Vision Inspection Pipeline (VIP) addresses a critical need in small-to-medium enterprise (SME) manufacturing environments where automated quality control is essential but cost-effective solutions are limited. Traditional manual inspection processes are labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to human error, while existing automated systems often require significant capital investment and specialized expertise.

This project develops a **semi-automated inspection system** specifically designed for plastic container defect detection, leveraging classical computer vision techniques to provide an accessible, cost-effective solution for SME manufacturers. The system focuses on detecting five critical defect types: scratches, contamination, discoloration, cracks, and flash defects.

### Key Contributions

1. **Comprehensive Detection System**: Implementation of 5 specialized classical computer vision detectors
2. **Benchmarking Framework**: Reproducible evaluation system with standardized metrics
3. **Dataset Integration**: Curation and integration of 4 production-ready datasets with standardized manifests
4. **Performance Improvements**: Empirically validated enhancements achieving up to 75% improvement in detection rates
5. **Production Readiness**: Complete testing framework with 39 passing tests and professional code standards

### Impact for SMEs

The VIP system provides SMEs with:
- **Cost-Effective Quality Control**: CPU-based processing without expensive GPU requirements
- **Real-Time Processing**: 8-16 images per second throughput suitable for production lines
- **Configurable Detection**: Adjustable sensitivity and defect type selection
