# Quick Start Guide for Thesis Supervisors

**For evaluating the Vision Inspection Pipeline thesis project**

## 5-Minute Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ajatam099/workVIP.git
cd workVIP

# 2. Run automated setup
python setup.py

# 3. Test web interface
python start_server.py
# Open browser to http://localhost:8000 and upload any image
```

### Option 2: Manual Setup
```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/ajatam099/workVIP.git
cd workVIP
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Verify installation
python -m pytest tests/ -q  # Should show "39 passed"

# 3. Test web interface
python start_server.py
```

## Key Evaluation Points

### 1. Core Functionality Test
- **Web Interface**: Upload any image at http://localhost:8000
- **Expected**: Color-coded defect detection results
- **Performance**: Real-time processing (~50-200ms per image)

### 2. Test Suite Validation
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
# Expected: 39/39 tests passing
# Categories: 17 detector tests, 9 pipeline tests, 13 benchmarking tests
```

### 3. Benchmarking Framework (Optional - requires datasets)
```bash
# Quick benchmark without datasets (uses demo data)
python scripts/bench_run.py --config bench/configs/experiments/baseline_demo.yaml

# View results
ls results/  # Shows generated benchmark reports
```

## Dataset Access (Optional for Full Evaluation)

**Note**: Datasets are ~2GB and not included in repository. For full benchmarking:

### Automatic Download (if working)
```bash
python scripts/download_datasets.py
```

### Manual Download Links

1. **Primary Dataset**: [Roboflow Plastic Defects](https://universe.roboflow.com/panops/plastic-defects)
   - Most important for thesis evaluation
   - 450 images, CC BY 4.0 license
   - Extract to: `data/raw/roboflow_plastic_defects/`

2. **Comparative Datasets**:
   - [NEU Steel Defects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhdikshit/neu-surface-defect-database) → `data/raw/neu_surface_defects/`
   - [GC10-DET Metal Defects](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alex000kim/gc10det) → `data/raw/gc10_det/`

After manual download:
```bash
python scripts/create_manifests.py  # Create standardized dataset files
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

**"Module not found"**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"Tests failing"**
```bash
# Clear cache and retry
rm -rf __pycache__ src/__pycache__ tests/__pycache__
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

**"No datasets"**
- System works without datasets (uses demo data)
- For full evaluation, download datasets using links above
- Automatic download may fail due to API keys/access restrictions

**"Benchmark fails"**
```bash
# Use demo configuration that doesn't require datasets
python scripts/bench_run.py --config bench/configs/experiments/baseline_demo.yaml
```
